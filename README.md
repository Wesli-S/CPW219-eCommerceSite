# CPW219-eCommerceSite
The purpose of this project is to get experience in using [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet), [CRUD Functionality](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/crud/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) in Microsoft Visual Studio.

## The Project
For the time being, the project is simply a testing ground of sorts to get used to the concepts listed above. This version of the assignment is tailored to mimic a website for a fictional cafÃ©, specifically what food and beverage items are available for purchase. A database was created alongside this project in order to keep track of these items, as well as maintain order in the code overall.
